# UVL - Universal Variability Language

**UVL (Universal Variability Language)** is a concise and extensible language for modeling variability in software product lines. It supports multiple programming languages and provides a grammar-based foundation for building tools and parsers.

This repository contains the **ANTLR4 grammar files** for UVL. With these, you can generate parsers for UVL tailored to specific programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and Python.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Language-level modularity
- Namespaces and imports
- Feature trees with attributes and cardinalities
- Cross-tree constraints
- Extensible for different target languages

## üì¶ Repository Structure

- `uvl/UVLParser.g4` ‚Äì Base grammar in EBNF form
- `uvl/UVLLexer.g4` ‚Äì Base lexer grammar for UVL
- `uvl/Java/UVLJava*.g4`, `uvl/Python/UVLPython*.g4`, etc. ‚Äì Language-specific grammar files
- `java/` ‚Äì Java-based parser implementation using Maven
- `python/` ‚Äì Python-based parser implementation
- `javascript/` ‚Äì JavaScript-based parser implementation
- `tests/` ‚Äì UVL test cases for validation

UVL uses [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) as its parser generator.

## üí° Language Overview

Each UVL model may consist of five optional sections:

1. **Language levels**: Enable optional concepts via `include` keyword.
2. **Namespace**: Allows referencing the model from other UVL models.
3. **Imports**: Include other feature models (e.g., `subdir.filename as fn`).
4. **Feature tree**: Hierarchical features with cardinalities, attributes, and group types (`mandatory`, `optional`, `or`, `alternative`).
5. **Cross-tree constraints**: Logical and arithmetic constraints among features.

### üîç Example

```uvl
namespace Server

features
  Server {abstract}
    mandatory
      FileSystem
        or
          NTFS
          APFS
          EXT4
      OperatingSystem {abstract}
        alternative
          Windows
          macOS
          Debian
    optional
      Logging {
        default,
        log_level "warn"
      }

constraints
  Windows => NTFS
  macOS => APFS
```

**Explanation:**
- `Server` is an abstract feature.
- It must include a `FileSystem` and an `OperatingSystem`.
- `Logging` is optional and includes an attribute.
- Logical constraints define dependencies between features.

## Usage 
To use UVL in your projects, you can either:
1. **Use the pre-built parsers**
    ### Java Parser
    Include the following dependency in your Maven project:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.universal-variability-language</groupId>
        <artifactId>uvl-parser</artifactId>
        <version>0.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
    ### Python Parser
    Install the package via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install uvlparser
    ```
    ### JavaScript Parser
    Install the package via npm:
    ```bash
    npm install uvl-parser
    ```
2. **Build the parser manually** See the sections below for details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building the Parser manually
### Java Parser
#### Prerequisites

- [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/)
- Java 17+
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

#### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-parser
   ```

2. Build the parser:
  ```bash
   cd java
   mvn clean package
  ```

3. Include the generated JAR in your Java project.
